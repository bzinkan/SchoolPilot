## Dashboard Overview

### Main View

The dashboard displays students in a **grid layout** with real-time activity cards.

#### Student Tile Information

Each student tile shows:
- **Student Name** and photo (if available)
- **Current Activity** - What website/tab they're viewing
- **Status Icon** - Online (🟢), Idle (🟡), Monitoring signal lost (🔴), or Not logged in (⚫)
- **Camera Active** - Purple camera icon (📷) if camera is on
- **Lock Status** - Lock icon (🔒) if screen is locked
- **Selection Checkbox** - For per-student targeting
- **Live View Button** - Click the eye icon (👁️) to watch their screen

#### Activity Categories

Students are automatically grouped into:

1. **Off-Task** (Red) - Visiting non-educational sites or blocklist violations
2. **On-Task** (Green) - Visiting approved educational websites  
3. **Idle** (Yellow) - No activity for 30+ seconds
4. **Monitoring signal lost** (Red) - No browser telemetry has arrived for 60 seconds; the cause is unknown
5. **Not logged in** (Gray) - No authenticated ClassPilot student session is active

### Statistics Bar

At the top of the dashboard:
- 📊 **Total Students** - Number of students in class
- 🟢 **Online** - Currently active students
- 🟡 **Idle** - Inactive but connected
- 🔴 **Signal Lost** - Signed-in students whose browser telemetry is at least 60 seconds old
- ⚫ **Not Logged In** - Students without an authenticated extension session
- 📷 **Camera Active** - Students with camera on
- 🔒 **Locked** - Students with locked screens

### Grade Tabs

Switch between different grade levels or class groups:
- Click grade tabs to filter students
- Add/remove grades via Settings
- Manage grade assignments in Roster Management

---

## Schedule Changes

ClassPilot can exchange the automatic class times of two eligible classes for
one instructional date. The change affects only the scheduled times: teachers,
co-teachers, students, class ownership, and recurring schedules stay the same.
The regular schedule resumes automatically on the next instructional day.

### Request a Time Swap

1. Open **My Settings**, then select **Schedule Changes**.
2. Select **Request time swap**.
3. Choose the instructional date and an eligible class pair.
4. Enter the required reason or an optional note, according to the school's
   policy, and review both normal and event-day times.
5. Select **Send request**.

The other class's primary teacher must accept the request. If the school
requires administrator approval, the request then moves to the administrator's
approval queue. A pending request does not change either schedule.

Use **Needs Action**, **Upcoming**, and **History** to review requests. A compact
Dashboard notice appears only on a day with an approved schedule change.

### Administrator Setup and Approval

- Open **Classes**, then **Schedule Changes**, to configure eligible class
  pairs, approve or deny requests, create an immediate one-day change, cancel
  an upcoming approved change, and review history.
- Open **Admin Settings**, then **Schedule Changes**, to enable teacher
  requests, require administrator approval, enforce the school-local same-day
  request cutoff, and require a reason from teachers. These controls are
  independent.
- If cutoff enforcement is off, teachers may request a same-day change until
  the earlier affected class begins. No setting permits a mid-period swap.
- Administrators must provide a reason when creating an immediate approved
  change, even when teacher reasons are optional.
- Class pairs must have active automatic schedules with equal-duration,
  non-overlapping periods.
- Approved changes cannot be cancelled after either affected block begins.

**Skip Today** applies to the class's event-day time and does not restore its
normal time or automatically skip the partner class.

## Student Monitoring

### Real-Time Activity Tracking

ClassPilot automatically tracks:
- **Tab Titles** - The title of the active browser tab
- **URLs** - Full website address
- **Favicons** - Website icons for quick recognition
- **Timestamps** - When each activity occurred
- **Website Duration** - Time spent on each site

**Update Frequency:** Every 10 seconds

If browser telemetry pauses for 60 seconds, ClassPilot enters **Updating monitoring…** while it confirms the student's status through realtime and server refresh. New commands are disabled whenever heartbeat telemetry is stale. A still-authorized screenshot remains normal until it is 75 seconds old, then stays dimmed and age-labeled until it reaches 120 seconds; at 120 seconds it is removed. A fresh authorized image may therefore remain visible beside a **Monitoring signal lost** warning, but it never makes controls available or substitutes for heartbeat coverage. If neither realtime nor server refresh can confirm the student's state, ClassPilot shows **Monitoring updates unavailable** so a service outage is not mistaken for a student disconnect. One newer exact-binding heartbeat restores the normal Online or Idle presentation immediately.

When the fast-preview capability is enabled for a school, ClassPilot requests a new still screenshot about every five seconds only while an authorized teacher or administrator is actively viewing that exact class. Leaving Class view, changing classes, or letting the observation lease expire returns the Chromebook to the normal 30-second background cadence. This is a faster sequence of authorized still images, not remote-control Live View. Screenshots keep the same 120-second maximum retention and are purged immediately when their authorization context changes.

For managed 2.7.3 clients at schools where the new capability is enabled, screenshot capture-health checks continue about every 30 seconds throughout the authenticated school tracking window, including between classes and when no dashboard is open. The server immediately discards image pixels captured outside a live authorized class. When a class begins or changes, the extension takes a new image for that exact class; a teacher can never receive pixels from the gap or the prior class.

### Activity Details

**Click on any student tile** to open the **Student Drawer** with detailed information:

#### Student Information Tab

---

## Remote Classroom Controls

### Understanding Delivery Status

ClassPilot reports classroom actions according to what the server and device have actually confirmed:

- **Restriction saved** - A persistent control such as Screen Lock, Flight Path, Block List, Attention Mode, tab limit, or temporary unblock is stored as the desired classroom state. If the student is unavailable, it remains pending and reconciles when monitoring resumes.
- **Delivery attempted** - A momentary action such as Open Tab, Close Tabs, Timer, or Poll was dispatched once. It expires after 15 seconds if the device does not acknowledge receipt and is not replayed later.
- **Acknowledged** - The extension reports that it received the action. Device acknowledgements are useful delivery evidence, but are not proof against tampering.
- **Not delivered**, **Failed**, or **Student unavailable** - The action was not confirmed as completed. ClassPilot does not describe it as opened, closed, locked, or sent successfully.
- **Message queued** - Teacher messages use the pending-message inbox and can be delivered after a temporary disconnection.

ClassPilot describes monitoring gaps only as **cause unknown**. A gap does not prove that a student disabled Wi-Fi, disabled the extension, cheated, or used AI.

### Per-Student Targeting

Remote controls can target specific students. Some actions may use the displayed
class when no students are selected, but **Lock** and **Unlock** always require
one or more explicitly selected students.

1. **Select Students** - Check boxes on student tiles
2. **Target Display** - Shows "Target: X selected" or "Target: All students"
3. **Apply Command** - Uses the target shown for that action
4. **Clear Selection** - "Clear Selection" button to deselect all

**Selection Controls:**
- ☑️ **Select All** - Target entire class
- ❌ **Clear Selection** - Deselect everyone
- Selection count badge shows how many selected

### Remote Tab Control

## Chrome Extension

### How It Works

The ClassPilot Chrome Extension runs silently in the background on student Chromebooks.

**Architecture:**
- **Manifest V3** - Modern, secure extension format
- **Service Worker** - Persistent background process
- **Content Scripts** - Inject into web pages for activity tracking
- **Offscreen Document** - WebRTC screen sharing handler

### Automatic Student Detection

**Google Workspace Integration:**
1. Extension uses Chrome Identity API
2. Detects student's Google Workspace email
3. Automatically registers device with email
4. No manual configuration needed

**What Students See:**
- Extension icon in toolbar (can be hidden by admin)
- Disclosure banner: "This device is being monitored"
- Screen share picker (on unmanaged devices only)

### Heartbeat System

The extension sends activity updates every **10 seconds**:

**What's Sent:**
- Current tab title
- Current URL
- Timestamp
- Student identifier
- Device identifier

**Reliability Features:**
- `chrome.alarms` API for persistent heartbeats
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Survives service worker sleep/wake cycles
- Network failure handling

### Activity Tracking

**Tab Navigation:**
- Detects when student switches tabs
- Tracks active tab changes
- Records navigation events

**Camera Detection:**
- Non-intrusive API wrapper
- Detects `getUserMedia()` calls
- No access to camera content
- Only knows camera is active/inactive

**Browsing Activity:**
- Uses `chrome.webNavigation` API
- Tracks page loads and navigations
- Records URL visits
- Captures page titles

### WebRTC Screen Sharing

**Two Capture Modes:**

**1. Silent Tab Capture** (Managed Chromebooks)
- Uses `chrome.tabCapture` API
- No student prompt required
- Requires Google Admin policy: "Allow tab capture"
- Instant streaming to teacher

**2. Screen Picker** (Fallback)
- Uses `getDisplayMedia()` API
- Student sees picker dialog
- Must select screen/window/tab
- Can deny request

**Connection Process:**
1. Teacher clicks "Watch Screen"
2. Extension receives request via WebSocket
3. Creates offscreen document for WebRTC
4. Attempts silent capture (if managed)
5. Falls back to picker if silent fails
6. Establishes peer connection to teacher
7. Streams video in real-time

**Network:**
- Uses STUN servers for NAT traversal
- Peer-to-peer WebRTC connection
- Low latency (~1-2 seconds)
- Adaptive bitrate

### Installation

**For IT Administrators:**

1. **Package Extension:**
   - Download ClassPilot extension folder
   - Create `.zip` file or `.crx` package

2. **Google Admin Console:**
   - Navigate to Devices → Chrome → Apps & Extensions
